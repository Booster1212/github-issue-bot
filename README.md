# Discord - GitHub Issue Bot

Simple Bot to create Issues on a repository through discord, powerd by DiscordJS & InversifyJS.

## Getting Started

- You will need a discord which can be created through Discord's Developer Portal, the bot must have an OAuth2 Scope of bot & application.commands at least.

- Clone the repository
- Install node_modules (npm install / npm i)
- Create a .env file in the root folder (no extension) - Do not push this to github ever!

## Configuration

- The .env file

```ts
BOT_ID=<BotClientID> // without < >
TOKEN=<YourBotToken> // From Discord Dev Portal without < >
GITHUB_TOKEN=<YourGithubAccessToken> // without < >
GUILD_ID=<YourDiscordServerID> // without < >
```

- The default configuration file

```ts
export const config = {
  commandPrefix: "!", // Probably removed next Update.

  enableChatCommands: false, // Probably removed next Update
  enableSlashCommands: true, // Recommend currently.

  githubRepoUserName: "Booster1212", // Your Github Username
  githubRepoName: "github-issue-bot", // The repository you want the issue to sent to.

  issueChannel: "976164749572194335", // Discord Channel where the /issue command should work
  issueMinLength: 15, // Description length must be at least 15 characters long.
  issueLabels: ["bug", "enhancement"], // Labels of your Github Repository are valid here.
};
```

### Executing program

- Build before you try to start the bot!

```
- npm run build
- npm run start
```

- If everything is setup correctly and your Bot is online & properly configured you should be able to use it!

```ts
/issue 'TITLE' 'DESCRIPTION' // Command Params.
```
